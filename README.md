# Design Patterns in Java

This repository contains implementations of various Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns in Java.  Design patterns are reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design.  They are a valuable tool for any developer to create flexible, maintainable, and scalable code.

* **Creational Patterns:**
    * Abstract Factory Pattern
    * Builder Pattern
    * Factory Pattern
    * Prototype Pattern
    * Singleton Pattern

* **Structural Patterns:**
    * Adapter Pattern
    * Bridge Pattern
    * Composite Pattern
    * Decorator Pattern
    * Facade Pattern
    * Flyweight Pattern
    * Proxy Pattern

* **Behavioral Patterns:**
    * Chain of Responsibility Pattern
    * Command Pattern
    * Interpreter Pattern
    * Iterator Pattern (Not explicitly listed in your image, but often included)
    * Mediator Pattern
    * Memento Pattern
    * Observer Pattern
    * State Pattern
    * Strategy Pattern
    * Template Pattern
    * Visitor Pattern

## Project Structure

The project is organized by pattern type, with each pattern residing in its own package.  For example, the Abstract Factory Pattern implementation can be found in the `Creational Patterns/Abstract Factory` directory.
